    <h4>
      Meatloaf but with a different take, this recipe involves flavours
      associated with salisbury steak. It combines the savory flavours of
      mushrooms with that all too good beef broth that we all love. This is by
      no means a quick dish but trust me it will be worth the wait.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
      <li>2 cups shiitake mushrooms, sliced</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups beef broth</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 (2 1/2 pound) uncooked prepared beef, veal and pork meatloaf</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in
        mushrooms and a pinch of salt; cook and stir until mushrooms begin to
        brown, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in fresh rosemary. Add flour and stir to coat the mushrooms; cook
        and stir for about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk in beef broth, 1/2 cup at a time, whisking constantly to prevent
        lumps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn heat to high and bring the sauce to a simmer. Simmer a few minutes
        until sauce starts to thicken. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from heat and stir in heavy cream.</li>
      <li>
        Slide prepared meatloaf into the sauce. Spoon sauce over the top of the
        meatloaf.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1
        1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
        read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove pan from the oven and gently remove meatloaf to a serving
        platter.
      </li>
      <li>Skim off any extra fat from the surface of the sauce.</li>
      <li>
        Bring the sauce to a boil over medium-high heat to reduce until thick,
        about 5 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
