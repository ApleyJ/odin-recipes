    <h4>
      This recipe is a different take of the regular sloppy joe we all known and
      love. Instead of on a bun we are going be making a casserole with the
      sloppy joe incorporated into it.

      <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups ketchup</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 (8.5 ounce) packages corn muffin mix</li>
      <li>2/3 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        Lightly spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; add ground beef, and cook,
        stirring occasionally and breaking up meat into smaller pieces with a
        wooden spoon, until almost fully browned, about 4 minutes. Add onion and
        bell pepper, and cook over medium-high, stirring occasionally, until
        softened and tender, 6 to 8 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until tomato paste has
        slightly darkened in color, about 2 minutes. Stir in beef broth, using a
        spatula to scrape any browned bits from bottom of pan. Stir in ketchup,
        mustard, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, garlic powder, and black pepper
        until fully combined. Bring to a boil over medium-high, and cook,
        stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens and bubbles appear all over
        the surface, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat, and transfer to the
        prepared baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together corn muffin mix, milk, baking powder, and eggs in a
        medium bowl until fully combined; spoon in an even layer over sloppy Joe
        filling
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cornbread is golden brown and a wooden
        pick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve
        immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
